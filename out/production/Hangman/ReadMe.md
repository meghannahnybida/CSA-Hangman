<h1> Text-based Hangman </h1>
<p> Aspects of the program: </p>
<ul> Guess the unknown word before the man gets hanged! </ul>
<ul> You get 5 misses. </ul>
<ul> The program prints out the letters you have already missed. </ul>
<ul> After the game is finished, the program will write who won the game (user or computer)
and how many letters you missed to the text file GameInfo. </ul>
<ul> Good luck! </ul>
